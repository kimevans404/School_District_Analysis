# School District Analysis
Data Manipulation with Pandas, Anaconda, Python
------------------------------------------------------------
Maria has gotten a new version of the student data with several changes. This includes an additional column: "school budget". She wants you to rework part of your analysis by using the new dataset.

## Summary of Analysis

In Deliverable 2 of this project, null values and duplicate rows were dropped from the orginal data which brought the total rows from 19,513 to 14,831. Dropping these rows reduces the data to 76% of what we started with. The null values were in the reading_scores and math_scores columns, so if the analysis did not need these columns, it may have been possible to keep them as long as there were no duplicates among these rows.

Deliverable 3 shows that the data will cover high school grades 9-12 and shows a broad overview of the statistics for the reading scores, math scores, and school budgets, but it can definitely be improved upon for deeper analysis.

Deliverable 4 is a short assessment of more specific data such as looking for the lowest reading score in the dataset, then reviewing all reading scores for 10th graders at Dixon HS to compare, and checking average reading scores for 11th and 12th graders. This output will show if reading scores are trending down, or if this one student is an outlier with their reading grade.

Deliverable 5 makes comparisons on the school level. First finding an average budget, finding the total number of students per school, and checking the average math score by school type. Looking at data at this high of a level can appear to be biased in some instances, so I would do a little more digging into the comparison of student count to the budget, and grades in comparison to the budget.
